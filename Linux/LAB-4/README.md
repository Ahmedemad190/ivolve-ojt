#  Our goal is to Attach a 15GB disk to your VM, partition it into 5GB, 5GB, 3GB, and 2GB sections. Use the first 5GB partition as a file system, configure the 2GB partition as swap, initialize the second 5GB as a Volume Group (VG) with a Logical Volume (LV), then extend the LV by adding the 3GB partition
